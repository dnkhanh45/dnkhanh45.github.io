I am a research resident under the supervision of Prof. Viet Anh Nguyen at VinAI Research. I received a B.S. in computer science (under the supervision of Dr. Phi Le Nguyen) from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2022.

My research interests lie on the intersection of model interpretability and robustness in machine learning. Lately, I have been focusing on algorithmic recourse.
